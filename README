I don't have a modem on my iPad to test with (wifi only), and the IOS simulator of course doesn't provide that functionality... So this is very much alpha/beta software... I still need to clean up some things, but based on the events firing, it seems to mostly be working, though it may be firing WWANOnline events when there's actually no connection. I have to push this out to some iPads with modems for further testing. Anyone who can test this and give feedback would be greatly appreciated.
